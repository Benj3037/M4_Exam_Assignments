# M4_Exam_Assignment

## Introduction
This assignment is designed to explore the frontier of AI applications, focusing on the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector databases such as ChromDB and LanceDB, and the comparison of various prompt engineering techniques. The goal is to build an application that not only showcases advanced AI and DL capabilities but also evaluates the impact of different prompt strategies on model performance.
