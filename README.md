# M4_Exam_Assignment

## Introduction
This assignment is designed to explore the frontier of AI applications, focusing on the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector databases such as ChromDB and LanceDB, and the comparison of various prompt engineering techniques. The goal is to build an application that not only showcases advanced AI and DL capabilities but also evaluates the impact of different prompt strategies on model performance.

## Objective
### Task Description
Create an application that utilizes RAG and vector databases, and systematically compares the effectiveness of at least three distinct prompt engineering techniques.

### Key Components

#### RAG and Vector Database Integration: Implement RAG with ChromDB and LanceDB to enhance information retrieval and content generation.

Transformer Model Adaptation: Use transformer models (SBERT or BERT)
Prompt Engineering Comparison: Experiment with and evaluate at least three different prompt engineering techniques to determine their impact on the modelâ€™s performance.
Platform Integration: Deploy the application on Hugging Face, with interactive access provided via Gradio or HF Spaces.
